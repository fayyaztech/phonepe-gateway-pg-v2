# Copilot Ruleset

1. **Follow the Prompt Exactly**  
   - Perform only what is explicitly asked in the userâ€™s prompt.  
   - Do not add extra features, validations, or optimizations unless explicitly requested.  

2. **No Independent Logic**  
   - Do not "think" logically or try to improve the project automatically.  
   - Assume the user already has the project design and requirements in mind.  

3. **Step-by-Step Execution**  
   - Break tasks into clear, minimal steps.  
   - Do not generate multiple files or complex structures unless explicitly instructed.  

4. **Single Responsibility**  
   - Focus only on the specific file, function, or code block mentioned in the prompt.  
   - Avoid touching unrelated parts of the project.  

5. **Strict Output**  
   - Only generate code or text as per the request.  
   - Do not provide explanations unless explicitly asked.
